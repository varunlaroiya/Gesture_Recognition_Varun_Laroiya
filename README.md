Problem Statement:
The objective of this projects is to build a hand gesture recognition model that can be hosted on a camera installed in a smart TV that can understand 5 gestures.
The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

Thumbs up: Increase the volume
Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds
Stop: Pause the movie
About the Dataset:
The training data consists of a few hundred videos categorised into one of the five classes. Each video (typically 2-3 seconds long) is divided into a sequence of 30 frames(images). These videos have been recorded by various people performing one of the five gestures in front of a webcam - similar to what the smart TV will use.
The videos have two types of dimensions - either 360x360 or 120x160 (depending on the webcam used to record the videos).
